#Q6: Write a query to display the movie title, movie year, and movie cost for all movies that have a cost between $44.99 and $49.99 (result shown in Figure 7).
 
#Q7: Write a query to display the movie title, movie year, price description, and price rental fee for all movies that are in the genres Family, Comedy, or Drama (result shown in Figure 8).
 
#Q8: Write a query to display the movie number, movie title, and movie year for all movies that do not have a video (result shown in Figure 9).

#Q9: Write a query to display the membership number, first name, last name, and balance of the memberships that have a rental (result shown in Figure 10).

#Q10: Write a query to display the minimum balance, maximum balance, and average balance for memberships that have a rental (result shown in Figure 11).
 
#Q11: Write a query to display the membership name (concatenate the first name and last name with a space between them into a single column), membership address (concatenate the street, city, state, and zip codes into a single column with spaces (result shown in Figure 12).
 
#Q12: Write a query to display the rental number, rental date, video number, movie title, due date, and return date for all videos that were returned after the due date.  Sort the results by rental number and movie title (result shown in Figure 13).

#Q13: Write a query to display the rental number, rental date, video number, movie title, due date, return date, detail fee, and number of days past the due date that the video was returned for each video that was returned after the due date.  Sort the results by rental number and movie title. (Result shown in Figure 14.)
 
#Q14: Write a query to display the rental number, rental date, movie title, and detail fee for each movie that was returned on or before the due date (result shown in Figure 15).    

#Q15: Write a query to display the membership number, last name, and total rental fees earned from that membership (result shown in Figure 16).  The total rental fee is the sum of all of the detail fees (without the late fees) from all movies that the membership has rented. 

#Q16: Write a query to display the movie number, movie genre, average movie cost of movies in that genre, movie cost of that individual movie, and the percentage difference between the average movie cost and the individual movie cost (result shown in Figure 17).  Note: the percentage difference is calculated as the cost of the individual movie minus the average cost of movies in that genre, divided by the average cost of movies in that genre multiplied by 100.  For example, if the average cost of movies in the “Family” genre is $25, if a given Family movie cost $26, then the calculation would be ((26 – 25) / 25 * 100), which would work out to be 4.00%.   This indicates that this movie costs 4% more than the average Family movie.
